# pyWWTP
Python simulation for a WWTP.

This project intends to provide a simulation of a wastewater treatment plant. The focus is on providing IO to develop PLC programs and SCADA solutions agaisnt.

The aim also is to havea solid code base. Ducttape is to be avoided.

## Just trowing key words in a list
* use TDD
* use a CI/CD pipeline
* unit prcesses (pumping, clarification, sluge dewatering etc. ) can work as stand alone modules
* able to be dockerised
* able to run multiple instances at a time to simulate an area with a multiple treatment plants
* suports OPC
* suports MQTT
* suports connection to UNS solutions
* connectable with Grafana
* connectable with Cognite
* suports connection to a historian
* can simulate process faults
* serves as a resume project
* suport contribution from other GitHub accounts
* support accelerated time for fast testing
* to be continued
