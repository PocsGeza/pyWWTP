# pyWWTP
Python simulation for a Waste Watewr Treatment Plant (WWTP) or multiple treatment plants in a geographic area.

This project intends to provide a simulation of a wastewater treatment plant. The focus is on providing IO to develop PLC programs and SCADA solutions against.

Reliable process data (BOD, COD, TOC ect.) predictions are not in focus but may be added later.

The aim also is to have a solid code base. Duct tape solutions are to be avoided.

## Just throwing key words in a list
* use TDD
* use a CI/CD pipeline
* unit processes (pumping, clarification, sludge dewatering etc. ) can work as stand alone modules
* able to be dockerized
* able to run multiple instances at a time to simulate an area with a multiple treatment plants
* supports OPC
* supports MQTT
* supports connection to UNS solutions
* connectable with Grafana
* connectable with Cognite
* supports connection to a historian
* can simulate process faults
* serves as a resume project
* support contribution from other GitHub accounts
* support accelerated time for fast testing
* to be continued
